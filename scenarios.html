    <h1>IAM Policy Visualization - Use Cases</h1>
    <div class="scenario">
        <h2>1. Security Audits and Compliance</h2>
        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A security team needs to audit IAM policies to ensure compliance with internal security standards and regulatory requirements.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The visualization tool can quickly highlight overly permissive policies, helping auditors identify and mitigate security risks.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="scenario">
        <h2>2. Policy Debugging and Troubleshooting</h2>
        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A developer encounters access issues while deploying an application and needs to troubleshoot IAM policies.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The tool provides a clear, visual representation of the policies, making it easier to identify misconfigurations and resolve access issues efficiently.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="scenario">
        <h2>3. Least Privilege Principle Implementation</h2>
        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> An organization aims to implement the principle of least privilege across its AWS environment to minimize security risks.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The tool helps visualize current policies, making it easier to adjust permissions and ensure users have only the access they need.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="scenario">
        <h2>4. Policy Optimization and Refactoring</h2>
        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A cloud architect is tasked with optimizing existing IAM policies for better performance and security.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> By visualizing policies, the architect can identify redundant or conflicting rules and refactor them for simplicity and efficiency.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="scenario">
        <h2>5. Educational and Training Purposes</h2>
        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> An AWS training program aims to educate new users on IAM policies and best practices.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The tool can be used to demonstrate real-world scenarios, helping trainees understand the impact of various policy configurations visually.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="scenario">
        <h2>6. Policy Documentation and Reporting</h2>
        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A team needs to document their IAM policies for internal reporting and external audits.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The tool can generate visual reports that are easy to understand and present, simplifying the documentation process.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="scenario">
        <h2>7. Access Review Meetings</h2>
        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Regular access review meetings are held to ensure appropriate permissions are granted to all users.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The tool provides a clear visual overview of who has access to what, facilitating more productive and insightful access review discussions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="scenario">
        <h2>8. Cloud Migration Projects</h2>
        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A company is migrating its on-premises infrastructure to AWS and needs to set up IAM policies for the new environment.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The tool helps visualize and compare existing and new policies, ensuring a smooth transition while maintaining security standards.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="scenario">
        <h2>9. Collaboration Between Teams</h2>
        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Different teams within an organization need to collaborate on IAM policy management.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The tool provides a common visual language, making it easier for non-technical stakeholders to understand and contribute to policy discussions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="scenario">
        <h2>10. Incident Response</h2>
        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> An incident response team needs to quickly assess IAM policies during a security incident.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The tool allows for rapid visualization and analysis of IAM policies, aiding in swift decision-making during critical incidents.</p>
